# ML-Projects

This repository contains my hands-on projects in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.  
Projects are based on the book *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow* and cover supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms.

## About Me
I am a student in AI at ENIAD, passionate about data-driven solutions and applied AI.  
I enjoy experimenting with datasets, building models, and sharing results in Python.

## Repository Structure
- Each project has its own folder
-  Each project folder contains:
- `notebook.ipynb` – the Jupyter notebook
- `data/` – datasets used
- `README.md` – project-specific description
